I/O Adresses of 8254 PIT;
F0H-Counter 0
F1H-Counter 1
F2H-Counter 2
F3H-Control Reg.

*Counter 0 and 1 are programmed Mode 3 as divide by 2000 (square-wave) counters. Assuming a 2MHz. System clock, this results in a frequency at OUT1 of;

2x106/(2000x2000)=0.5Hz.

A 0.5 Hz. Square-wave has a 2s Period.








Assume that counter 2 contains 3275 just after OUT1 goes low. What is the frequency of the CLK2 input. 

f in=9999-3275=6724 Hz.
